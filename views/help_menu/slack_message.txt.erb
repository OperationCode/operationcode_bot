Slack is an online chatroom service that the Operation Code community uses.
It can be accessed online, via https://operation-code.slack.com/ or via
desktop or mobile apps, located at https://slack.com/downloads/. In addition to
chatting, Slack also allows us to share files, audio conference and even program
our own bots! Here are some tips to get you started:
  - You can customize your notifications per channel by clicking the gear to the
    left of the search box
  - Join as many channels as you want via the + next to Channels in the side bar.
