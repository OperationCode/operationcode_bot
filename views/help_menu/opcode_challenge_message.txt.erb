Welcome to the Operation Code challenge! The goal of this challenge is to get
you to easily commit your first change to a program, see the results of the
change, and leave your mark on Operation Code itself!

To do this we're going to take a look at a source code repository, clone the
repository, make a change to a file and finally create a pull request. Let's
get started!

The first step we need to take is to visit the Github repository for this bot.
Github is a website dedicated to hosting source code. You can see all of the
code written and used by Operation Code here: https://github.com/OperationCode
Take a moment to explore Github.

You can see this message here:
https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_bot/blob/master/views/help_menu/opcode_challenge_message.txt.erb

The next thing we need to do is fork the repository. Forking a repository takes a
snapshot of the repo and places that snapshot into your personal area. This allows
anyone to make changes to any project and easily contribute them back.

The source code for this bot lives here:
https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_bot

Visit this link and click on the 'Fork' button in the top right corner.

You should see a message like 'Forking OperationCode/operationcode_bot' and in a
few moments be redirected to a URL like:
https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/operationcode_bot

Congratulations - you now have your very own personal copy of our bot!

Now lets edit a file to add your name! Click on the `opcode_challenge` directory
and click on the file called `names.txt`. On the right hand side you should see a
pencil icon. This will allow you to edit the file right on github!

Add your name to the file and then scroll to the bottom. Inside the `Commit changes`
box type 'Added <YOUR NAME>' into the box labeled `Update names.txt`.

Check the `Create a new branch` box and then click `Propose file change`.

Now navigate back to the repo we forked from:
https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_bot

You should see a new box showing 'Your recently pushed branches' with the name of the
branch you just created. It should look something like '<YOUR USERNAME>:<YOUR USERNAME>-patch-1'.
To the right of that you should see a 'Compare & pull request' button. Click on that to create
your first Pull Request!

A pull request is how people throughout the world are able to contribute to open source
software. When you submit a pull request it notifies the maintaners of the project, and runs
some automated checks. The maintainers then look at the new changes and decide if they want it
merged into their repository.

When you're ready click the 'Create pull request' button. Our staff will be notified and a few
minutes after the pull request is accepted and merged your name will show up below!

Congratulations - you've made your first open source commit!
