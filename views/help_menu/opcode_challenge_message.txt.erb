Welcome to the Operation Code challenge! The goal of this challenge is to get
you to easily commit your first change to a program, see the results of the
change, and leave your mark on Operation Code itself!

To get started all you need to do is visit https://operationcode.org/challenge
and follow the instructions. When you're all done your name will be on the 
Operation Code website for all to see!
