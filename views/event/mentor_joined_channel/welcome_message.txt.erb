Hi <%= @user.try(:name) %>,

Welcome to our internal Mentors channel! Thank you for volunteering your time to help our community. This channel is intended to be an open forum to for our mentors to discuss any mentorship-specific topics with one another.

Here is a quick rundown of how our Mentorship Program works:

Please refer new mentees to http://op.co.de/mentor-request.

Please make sure you've filled out http://op.co.de/mentor-enrollment.

Feel free to ask in this channel if you have any questions on how our Mentorship Program works, and let us know how we can improve it!
