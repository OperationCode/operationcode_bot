Hi <%= @user.try(:name) %>,

Welcome to Operation Code! I'm a bot designed to help answer questions and get you on your
way in our community.

Please take a moment to review our Code of Conduct:
https://op.co.de/code-of-conduct

Our goal here at Operation Code is to get veterans and their families started on the path to
a career in programming. We do that through providing you with scholarships, mentoring, career
development opportunities, conference tickets, and more!

You're currently in Slack, a chat application that serves as the hub of Operation Code.
If you're currently visiting us via your browser, Slack provides a stand alone program
to make staying in touch even more convenient. You can download it here:

Below you'll see a list of topics. You can click on each topic to get more info. If you
want to see the topics again just reply to me with any message.
