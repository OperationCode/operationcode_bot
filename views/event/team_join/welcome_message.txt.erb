*Share Your Story*
Please tell us a little bit about yourself in the #General channel. Let us know your name, where you are from, your branch of service (if applicable), your skill level as a developer, and what you are interested in learning. Don't be shy; some days we are more chatty than others.

We have channels for just about everything.
Here are a few channel recommendations for you:
If you are new to coding, join the #newbies channel.
You can ask any question in the #questions channel.
We have channels for most major languages, as well as a #job_board and a #career_advice channel for job-seekers.

We also have a _ton_ of reactions for our members to use to respond to other members. A team favorite is :party-parrot:.
